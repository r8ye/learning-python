Problem 1: Basic Formatting and Concatenation
You are given a student's name, a major, and an ID number (which should be treated as a number for potential calculations, but displayed as a string).
student_name = "Alex Rodriguez"
major = "Electronics Engineering"
id_number = 202312345
Create a multiline string that holds the text "Student Profile".
Use f-strings to create a final string that displays the following information on one line: "Profile: [student_name] - Major: [major] - ID: [id_number]"
Print the multiline string followed by the final string.
output:
Student Profile
Profile: Alex Rodriguez - Major: Electronics Engineering - ID: 202312345

Problem 2: Indexing, Slicing, and Reversal
You are given the following string: quote_phrase = "Coding is fun and useful for everyone!"
Use indexing to extract and print the first letter of the phrase and the letter 'u' from the word "useful".
Use slicing to extract and print the substring "fun and useful".
Print the entire quote_phrase in reverse.
output:
C
u
fun and useful

Problem 3: The Mixed Challenge (F-strings, Slicing, and the in Operator)
You are given the following information:
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
secret_word = "ox j"
Use the in operator to check if the secret_word is present in the sentence and store the result in a boolean variable named is_present.
Use slicing (with only the start:stop parameters) on the sentence to extract the word "jumps". Store this word in a variable named action_word.
Use an f-string to create a final print statement that says: "The word we found is: [action_word]. Is the secret word part of the sentence? [is_present]."
output:
The word we found is: jumps. Is the secret word part of the sentence? True.
