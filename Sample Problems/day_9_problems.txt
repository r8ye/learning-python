PROBLEM 1: Student Qualification Checker
Difficulty: Easy–Medium
Topics: logical operators, if/elif/else, type conversion, string operations

You are given three input values:

age (string input, convert to int)

citizen (string: "yes" or "no")

education (string: may contain uppercase/lowercase)

A student is considered qualified if:

Age is 18 or older, AND

Citizenship is "yes", AND

Education is either "bachelor", "masters", or "phd" regardless of case.

Return:

"Qualified" if all conditions are met

"Not qualified" otherwise

Additional rules:

Trim whitespace around each input.

Use .lower(), .strip(), and logical operators.

Example:
Input: " 18 ", "YES", "MasterS" → Output: "Qualified"

PROBLEM 2: Math Engine Function
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: arithmetic operations, augmented assignment, functions, return values

Create a function math_engine(a, b) that:

Adds 10 to a using augmented assignment.

Multiplies b by 4 using augmented assignment.

Computes the following final expression:

result = (a + b) * (a - b) / (a // 3)


Rules:

Ensure floor division a // 3 does not result in zero. If dividing by zero would occur, return "Invalid operation".

Return the computed result as a float.

Example:
Input: a = 9, b = 3
Your function should perform all augmented steps before computing the expression.

PROBLEM 3: String Mutation Simulator
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: immutability, string methods, loops, modulo, concatenation

Given a string text and an integer n:
Perform the following algorithm:

Convert text to lowercase.

If the string starts with a vowel, append " start" to the string.

Repeat the following n times:

If current index i modulo 2 equals 0, uppercase the string.

Else, lowercase the string.

After modifying the string, append the string length to the end. Example: "hello5"

Return the final transformed string.

Example:
Input: "Apple", n = 3
(Exact output depends on the step-by-step process.)

PROBLEM 4: Salary Adjustment Calculator
Difficulty: Medium–Hard
Topics: if-elif-else, augmented operators, floats, rounding, formatting

You are to compute an employee's adjusted salary:

Inputs:

salary (float)

years_experience (int)

is_manager (bool)

Rules:

If experience >= 10: add 15% to salary

Else if experience >= 5: add 7%

Else: add 2%

If is_manager == True: add an additional fixed 5000

After adjustments, apply:
salary //= 1.5

Round final salary to 2 decimal places

Return the final salary.

PROBLEM 5: Nested Scope Calculator
Difficulty: Hard
Topics: local, nonlocal, global scope, custom functions, arithmetic, type conversion

Global variable:

global_result = 10


Create a function outer(x, y) that:

Defines a local variable z = x * y

Inside outer, create an inner function modify() that:

Uses nonlocal to modify z → z += x

Creates another function deep() inside it which:

Uses global to modify global_result → multiply it by y

Returns z - global_result

modify() returns the output of deep()

outer(x,y) should return the final result of modify().

Example call:
outer(3, 4)

You must correctly handle scope behavior.
