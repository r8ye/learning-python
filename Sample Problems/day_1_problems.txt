Problem 1: Variable Creation and Output
Goal: Create variables of different data types and use the print() function to display information about them.
Create an integer variable named user_age and assign it your age.
Create a string variable named user_city and assign it the name of your favorite city.
Create a boolean variable named is_learning_python and set it to True.
Using a single print() statement, display a sentence that combines the text "My age is", the value of user_age, the text "and I'm learning Python from", and the value of user_city.
The output should be easy to read and grammatically sound.

Problem 2: Data Type Identification and Mutability
Goal: Use the type() function and demonstrate an understanding of mutable/immutable types.
Define a variable mystery_data and assign it the value ["red", 42, 3.14].
Print the current value of mystery_data.
Print the data type of mystery_data using the type() function.
Since this type is mutable, change the second element (the number 42) in mystery_data to a new string value: "blue".
Print the value of mystery_data again to show the change.
Now, define a new variable another_mystery and assign it the string value "Immutability".
Print the data type of another_mystery. (You do not need to attempt to change a part of this variable, just show its type).

Problem 3: Exploring Complex and Group Data Types
Goal: Work with a less common numerical type (complex) and a common collection type (dictionary).
Define a variable named electrical_impedance and assign it a complex number value, for example, 10 + 5j.
Print the value and the data type of electrical_impedance in the same line, clearly labeled (e.g., "Impedance Value: [value] | Type: [type]").
Define a dictionary named student_info with the following key-value pairs:
"id": an integer (e.g., 1001)
"major": a string (e.g., "Computer Science")
"gpa": a float (e.g., 3.85)
Using a single print() statement, display the contents of the entire student_info dictionary.
