🧠 Problem 1 — Enclosing Scope Variable Override (Hard)

You are given the following function structure:

def mystery():
    txt = "outer"

    def change():
        # your code here
        print(txt)

    change()
    print(txt)


Your task:
Modify the code inside change() so that:

The first print outputs:

modified inner


The second print outputs:

modified outer


Rules / Restrictions:

You must not recreate txt locally in change().

You must modify the variable in the outer function.

You may only use what the original code uses (like nonlocal, assignment, print).

Expected Output:

modified inner
modified outer


Concepts tested:

Enclosing scope

nonlocal

Inner modifying outer


🧠 Problem 2 — Global vs Local Collision (Hard)

Analyze this incomplete code:

value = "GLOBAL"

def test():
    value = "LOCAL"

    def inner():
        # your code here
        print(value)

    inner()
    print(value)

print(value)
test()
print(value)


Your task:
Modify only one line inside inner() so that the final output becomes:

GLOBAL
GLOBAL
LOCAL
GLOBAL


Rules:

You cannot move or remove existing lines.

You cannot add another variable.

You must use only allowed concepts (global, reading variables, assignment).

You must not modify lines outside inner().

Goal:
Make inner() print the global value, then after the outer print(), print the local value, and finally the global value again.

Concepts tested:

Global scope

Local shadowing

Using global inside a nested function


🧠 Problem 3 — Password Router Using Scope Rules (Hard)

Given this structure:

password = "root"

def system():
    password = "user"

    def reset():
        # your code here
        print(password)

    reset()
    print(password)

print(password)
system()
print(password)


Your task:
Modify only the code inside reset() so that the final output becomes:

root
admin
admin
admin


Rules:

You must transform the local password in system() into "admin".

You must also make the global password become "admin" by the end.

You cannot modify any line outside reset().

You can use only:

global

nonlocal

assignments

prints

Concepts tested:

global scope updating

nonlocal modifying outer

order of prints

shadowing
