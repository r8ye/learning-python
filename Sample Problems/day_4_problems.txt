Problem 1 — Shopping Cart Calculation
Scenario:
You buy 3 items priced at 12.75, 9.99, and 5. You have a discount of 8% and a tax of 12.5%.
Compute total price
Apply discount
Add tax
Round final price to 2 decimal places
Calculate floor division by 3 (items per person)
Compute modulo 7 of total price for a special coupon
Show types of all results

Desired Output Example:
Total: 27.74, Discounted: 25.51, Taxed: 28.70, Floor Division: 9.0, Modulo 7: 6.74, Type of Total: <class 'float'>

Problem 2 — Mixed Numbers and Powers
Scenario:
You have an integer x = 7 and a float y = -2.5.
Add, subtract, multiply, and divide them
Perform floor division
Compute x raised to y as a float
Compute pow(x, 3, 5) for modular exponentiation
Round results to 1 decimal place
Convert float division result to int

Desired Output Example:
Sum: 4.5, Difference: 9.5, Product: -17.5, Division: -2.8, Floor Division: -3.0, Power x^y: 0.018, Modular Pow: 3, Rounded Division: -2.8, Converted Int: -2

Problem 3 — Temperature Conversion and Analysis
Scenario:
You record temperatures in Celsius: t1 = -7.5, t2 = 23, t3 = 0.
Convert each to Fahrenheit (C * 9/5 + 32)
Compute average temperature in Fahrenheit
Compute sum, difference, product, and modulo of t2 and t1
Floor divide t2 by t3 + 1 (to avoid zero division)
Round average to 2 decimal places
Convert average to int

Desired Output Example:
Fahrenheit: -9.5, 73.4, 32.0, Avg: 31.97, Sum: 15.5, Difference: 30.5, Product: -172.5, Modulo: 23.5, Floor Division: 23, Rounded Avg: 31.97, Int Avg: 31
